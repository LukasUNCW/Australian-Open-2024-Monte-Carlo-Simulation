# Australian-Open-2024-Monte-Carlo-Simulation
This project uses a surface-weighted Elo model trained on ATP match data from 2021–2023 to run a Monte Carlo simulation of the 2024 Australian Open men’s draw. Using the official bracket, the tournament is simulated 100,000 times to estimate round-by-round advancement and title probabilities.
